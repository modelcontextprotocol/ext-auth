# MCP Authorization Extensions

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification is defined in the [main specification repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/tree/main/docs/specification). This repository contains **extensions** to the core protocol that define additional authorization mechanisms.

These extensions are:

- **Optional** - Implementations can choose to adopt these extensions
- **Additive** - Extensions do not modify or break core protocol functionality; they add new capabilities while preserving core protocol behavior
- **Composable** - Extensions are modular and designed to work together without conflicts, allowing implementations to adopt multiple extensions simultaneously
- **Versioned independently** - Extensions follow the core MCP versioning cycle but may adopt independent versioning as needed

## Governance

This repository follows the [Model Context Protocol Governance](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/governance) process, with a dedicated set of maintainers for authorization extensions. See [MAINTAINERS.md](./MAINTAINERS.md) for the list of maintainers specific to this repository.

All decisions regarding authorization extensions follow the same governance model as the core specification, including:

- Specification Enhancement Proposals (SEPs)
- Community discussion and consensus building
- Maintainer review and approval
- Transparent decision-making
